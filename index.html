        <p class="post-one">To begin this list, I decided to put a picture of a Shiba Inu with a stack of oranges
            on their head. Tell me if you ever saw a cuter picture than this? Of course not. </p>

        <p class="post-two">Secondly, may I present a picture of a Shiba Inu with a cob of corn on their head. It's
            not as good as the first one but nevertheless still adorable.</p>

        <img class="post-picture" src="images/banana.jpg" alt="third-picture">
        <p class="post-three">In third place I decided to give it to the White Inu with the banana on his head. Overall, a decent picture
            that's worthy of third place.</p>
